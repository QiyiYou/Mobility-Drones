# Performance Characterization of Canonical Mobility Models in Drone Cellular Networks

## MATLAB scripts and functions.

### Authors: Morteza Banagar and Harpreet S. Dhillon

This repository contains matlab codes for the simulations in [1]. In each folder, you can find the required codes (and data if applicable) to regenerate all simulation plots provided in [1]. For analytical evaluations, Monte-Carlo (MC) integration has been used.

Please cite [1] if you reuse these codes.

Parts of [1] will be presented at the 2019 IEEE Globecom in Waikoloa, HI, USA [2], [3]. The repository for the codes of [3] can be found [here](https://github.com/stochastic-geometry/SRWP-Drones).
